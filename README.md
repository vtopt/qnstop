# [QNSTOP: quasi-Newton stochastic optimization algorithm.](https://vtopt.github.io/qnstop/)

The package  QNSTOP  is a suite of serial and parallel Fortran 95/2003 codes
for deterministic global optimization and stochastic optimization, with
the serial driver subroutine  QNSTOPS  and the parallel driver subroutine
QNSTOPP. The organization of this repository is:

+ `src` contains the ACT TOMS code. See the `README` here for further details.
+ `docs` contains website docs.
